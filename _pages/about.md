I'm currently a Ph.D. student (5-year program) in the Natural Language and Representation Lab (NRL), [Information Science and Technology (IST) at VISTEC](https://vistec.ist/), Thailand.
I'm working with [Assoc. Prof. Dr. Sarana Nutanong](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=fEPAC_AAAAAJ&hl=th) and [Dr. Ekapol Chuangsuwanich](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=ST-jPeYAAAAJ&hl=th).

My research topics
======
- Word segmentation ([EMNLP'20](https://www.aclweb.org/anthology/2020.emnlp-main.315/), [ACL'21](https://aclanthology.org/2021.findings-acl.86.pdf))
- Multilingual sentence- and document-level retrievals ([NAACL'22](https://openreview.net/forum?id=y42xxJ_xx8), [ACL'23](https://aclanthology.org/2023.acl-short.95.pdf))
- Representation learning ([EMNLP'22](https://github.com/KornWtp/ConGen/blob/main/ConGen__Unsupervised_Control_and_Generalization_Distillation_For_Sentence_Representation.pdf), [ACL'23](https://aclanthology.org/2023.acl-short.95.pdf), [TACL'23](https://direct.mit.edu/tacl/article/doi/10.1162/tacl_a_00620/118714/An-Efficient-Self-Supervised-Cross-View-Training))
- Question answering ([NAACL'22](https://openreview.net/forum?id=y42xxJ_xx8)).
- Information Extraction: Entity Linking ([EMNLP'23](https://aclanthology.org/2023.findings-emnlp.1007/)) and Nested NER ([ACL'22](https://aclanthology.org/2022.findings-acl.116/)). 

Research Experiences
======
- Subject Matter Expert of the [WangchanX project](https://www.wangchan.ai/home). Our team developed two Thai large language models: [WangchanGLM](https://github.com/PyThaiNLP/WangChanGLM) (based on XGLM) and [WangchanLion](https://huggingface.co/airesearch/WangchanLion7B) (based on SeaLION). Our team also planned to release the largest Thai instruction dataset in 2024.  
- Applied Science Intern at Amazon (2022-2023). Working with Weiwei Cheng (mentor), [Christos Christodoulopoulos](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=oZORQtwAAAAJ&hl=en), [Amir Saffari](https://scholar.google.co.uk/citations?user=QJX4mnQAAAAJ&hl=en), [Jens Lehmann](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=sEaQ5rgAAAAJ&hl=th&oi=ao), and Daniele Masato (PM).
