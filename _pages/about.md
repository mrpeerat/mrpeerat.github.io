I'm currently studying Ph.D. (5 years program) Scalable Data Systems (SCADS) Lab - Natural Language Processing and Understanding (NLPU) team, [information science and technology (IST) at VISTEC](https://vistec.ist/), Thailand.

I'm working with Assoc. Prof. Dr. Sarana Nutanong and [AIResearch Team](https://airesearch.in.th/).

I have extensive experience with Natural Language Processing (NLP) and Information Retrieval (IR), for instance,  word segmentation, multilingual sentence representation, multilingual sentence- and document-level retrievals, representation learning, and question answering.
