I'm currently a Ph.D student (5 years program) in Natural Language and Representation Lab (NRL), [information science and technology (IST) at VISTEC](https://vistec.ist/), Thailand.
I'm working with [Assoc. Prof. Dr. Sarana Nutanong](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=fEPAC_AAAAAJ&hl=th) and [Dr. Ekapol Chuangsuwanich](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=ST-jPeYAAAAJ&hl=th).
My research topics are Natural Language Processing (NLP) and Information Retrieval (IR), for instance,  word segmentation, multilingual sentence representation, multilingual sentence- and document-level retrievals, representation learning, and question answering.
