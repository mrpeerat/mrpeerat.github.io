I'm currently an AI Engineer at AI Singapore, NUS. My responsibility is to develop SEA LLMs and benchmarks. Before that, I was a Ph.D. student (5-year program) in the Natural Language and Representation Lab (NRL), [Information Science and Technology (IST) at VISTEC](https://vistec.ist/), Thailand.
My advisor and co-advisor were [Assoc. Prof. Dr. Sarana Nutanong](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=fEPAC_AAAAAJ&hl=th) and [Dr. Ekapol Chuangsuwanich](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=ST-jPeYAAAAJ&hl=th), respectively. During my Ph.D., I was an intern at Amazon, Cambridge, GBR (2022-2023). Working with Weiwei Cheng (mentor), [Christos Christodoulopoulos](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=oZORQtwAAAAJ&hl=en), [Amir Saffari](https://scholar.google.co.uk/citations?user=QJX4mnQAAAAJ&hl=en), [Jens Lehmann](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=sEaQ5rgAAAAJ&hl=th&oi=ao), and Daniele Masato (PM). I also was a part of [the WangchanX project](https://www.wangchan.ai/home) as a Subject Matter Expert (SME) from 2019-2024. Our team developed two Thai large language models: [WangchanGLM](https://github.com/PyThaiNLP/WangChanGLM) (based on XGLM) and [WangchanLion](https://huggingface.co/airesearch/WangchanLion7B) (based on SeaLION). Moreover, we released a [WangchanX toolkit](https://github.com/vistec-AI/WangchanX) for fine-tuning Thai LLMs. Our team also released the [largest Thai instruction dataset](https://huggingface.co/datasets/airesearch/WangchanThaiInstruct) in 2024.
